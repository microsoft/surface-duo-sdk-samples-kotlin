Different pen states detected by the sample:

- The green circle represents the point under the pen tip; its size is controlled by the pressure
- The blue circle size represents the pressure; it will turn pink if the button is pressed
- The red triangle represents the orientation
- If an eraser is used, the shapes will become outlines
