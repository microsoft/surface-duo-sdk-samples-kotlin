    <!-- Your app should work without any problem on single screen mode on Surface Duo as it works on any other
        single screen device; so it shouldn't be any reason to have specific resources for single screen mode.
        But for informative purposes, here is the resource folder (values-sw540dp-1350x1800 that Surface Duo uses
        when on single screen mode (both single-portrait and single-landscape) -->
    <string name="qualifiers_app_name">Qualifiers</string>
    <string name="qualifiers_hello_world">Hello World! \nSingle screen mode</string>
    <string name="qualifiers_resource_folder">sw540dp-1350x1800</string>
</resources>
